# Unreleased

- Group by, as in Windows Explorer: Sort > Group by groups a folder apart
  from its sort, so a folder grouped by date modified can be sorted by name
  within each group. The choices are Name (A - H, I - P, Q - Z), Date
  modified (Today, Yesterday, ... A long time ago), Type, Size, Date
  created, Same as sort (the former Show in groups) and (None). Downloads
  is grouped by date modified until another choice is made there. The Sort
  menu now matches Explorer's: Name, Date modified and Type, with Size and
  the further keys under More. The first group's heading is no longer
  hidden when a grouped folder opens.

- The note at the bottom of the Details pane ("Select an item to see its
  properties…") uses the pane's whole width instead of a narrow column.
- Escape closes an Open or Save dialog again while a file is selected in
  the list, as in Windows, instead of only clearing the selection.
- Optional: other applications' Open and Save dialogs in OpenXplorer.
  Settings > Default apps > "Apps' Open and Save dialogs" > Enable makes
  applications that use the desktop portal (Chrome, Firefox, Flatpak apps)
  choose and save files in an OpenXplorer window, with File name, the type
  list and Save or Open at the bottom. It is off until enabled, keeps every
  other portal backend, and Restore Open and Save dialogs undoes it. Host
  packages install `/usr/share/xdg-desktop-portal/portals/<id>.portal`;
  the Flatpak cannot offer it.

- Open and Save dialogs now cover KDE's own apps too (Plasma and its
  widgets, Kate, System Settings): on KDE Plasma, Enable also adds a login
  script, `~/.config/plasma-workspace/env/openxplorer-file-dialogs.sh`,
  that sets `PLASMA_INTEGRATION_USE_PORTAL=1`, so they ask the portal
  instead of showing KDE's dialog. It applies from the next login, and
  Restore removes it. Enable stays available for those who enabled the
  dialogs before, to add it. A file of the user's with that name is left
  alone, and the status line says so.

# 2.0.0 — 2026-09-28

OpenXplorer is now a native GTK 4 application written in Rust. It replaces the
Python/WebKitGTK app of 1.x under the same name, command, application ID
(`io.winspace.Development`), settings, pins, search cache and saved SMB
passwords. OpenXplorer 1.1.x offers it in **Check for updates**.

- The same Windows 11 File Explorer look, now drawn with native GTK 4 widgets
  instead of a web view.
- Microsoft Fluent icons for folders, files, drives and commands.
- A categorised Settings page: a category list on the left, one category at
  a time on the right.
- Undo and redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z) for copy, move, rename, new files and
  folders, and Move to Recycle Bin.
- Drop files onto a program or script to run it with those files.
- Tear a tab out into a new window, or drag it onto another window to merge
  it.
- Pinned folders are indexed for search by default.
- Packages for more distributions: the `.deb` for Zorin OS 18, Ubuntu 24.04
  and newer and Debian 13; RPMs for Fedora and openSUSE and a package for Arch
  Linux where the release lists them; and a Flatpak bundle for every
  distribution with Flatpak, including those whose GTK is older than 4.14.
- The Python app in `desktop/` is deprecated and no longer shipped (its sources remain at tag v2.0.0).

## Known gaps

- The **Location** tab of a known folder's Properties (moving Documents,
  Downloads and the other user folders) is a placeholder.
- The mount assistant's **Location** section (choosing where a persistent
  share is mounted) is not available yet.
- A few network protocols that Dolphin offers beyond SMB are not supported.
- Not yet in the native app: searching within Settings, dropping onto
  `.desktop` launchers, creating links and batch rename.
- Behaviour that is implemented but not yet covered by an automated native
  test, and the hardware acceptance still owed (SMB servers other than the
  maintainer's, phones, USB drives), are listed in
  [native/BACKLOG.md](native/BACKLOG.md).
- Inside the Flatpak, "Show in folder" cannot be turned on, the System theme
  stays light on a dark desktop, and settings are kept apart from a
  distribution package's (native/packaging/README.md, "Differences inside the
  Flatpak").

Rollback: `sudo apt install --allow-downgrades ./openxplorer_1.1.4_all.deb`
restores the Python app; settings and saved passwords are shared.
