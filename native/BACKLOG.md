# OpenXplorer native backlog

OpenXplorer 2.0.0 shipped the native app before the parity gate
`python3 native/parity/check.py --gate replace` passed: on 2026-09-28 the owner
made the remaining items a backlog instead of a release blocker. Parts 1 and 2
closed most of the initial gaps. Part 3 adds shared dialogs, thumbnail previews,
split panes, folder display styles, commands and transfer jobs, the folder tree
and translation support. This file lists what is still open in the current
source. `native/parity/features.toml` stays the source of truth: an item leaves this list when its status there becomes
"done" (implemented, and a native test carries its `parity: ID` marker).

"partial" means the behaviour is largely implemented but a part of it, or its
native test, is missing. "todo" means it is not implemented natively, or has
no native evidence yet. Each item's `native_note` in features.toml says what
is missing.

## Known functional gaps

- **Owner decisions still open.** These items of the replacement gate are
  implemented as Dolphin and Windows 11 behave and stay "partial" until the
  owner confirms the difference from the Python app:
  - SEL-002: a click on blank space clears the selection but keeps GTK's
    range anchor, so Shift+click extends from the last clicked item.
  - SEL-035 (with SEL-036): a lone Space selects the current item and never
    deselects it, instead of starting a type-ahead prefix.
  - CMD-017: Menu and Shift+F10 in a text field open the field's own menu, and
    Ctrl+H, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+Tab and Alt+Left/Right/Up also act
    from text fields. Typing with an input method (IME) is not verified.
  - XFER-011: a move that cannot be done natively asks "Move by copying?"
    once per operation; Cancel keeps the old refusal.
- **Checks this environment cannot run.** LOOK-028 (fractional scales and a
  window moving between monitors of different scales need a Wayland
  compositor), ACC-003 (nobody has checked the file list with Orca; the icon
  view exposes no item count or position for undrawn tiles) and PERF-008
  (the supported desktops, see below).
- **View coverage.** Ctrl+plus/minus/0 keep their existing text-size bindings;
  icon zoom uses Ctrl+wheel, the slider and named view shortcuts. Media, rating,
  tag and comment sort keys need a metadata provider. Details shows group
  headings; Icons and List currently show grouped order without headings.
  Preview settings offer a fixed large-file limit; folder artwork stays the
  bundled Fluent icon rather than a collage of the folder's contents.
- **Operation history.** Independent transfers have separate progress and
  cancellation panels, but completed and failed jobs are not retained and
  subsequent jobs are not queued (OPS-033).
- **Interface translations.** Menus, dialogs, Settings, backend messages,
  marked template text and package descriptions now use the catalogue
  tooling. No reviewed language catalogue ships; remaining English plural
  fragments, complete string coverage and right-to-left layout still need
  validation (INT-031).
- **Terminal.** View → Terminal opens the configured external terminal in the
  current folder. An embedded VTE terminal is not available across the current
  supported build targets and Flatpak configuration.
- **Archives.** Browsing and extraction support ZIP and compressed TAR. 7z,
  RAR, encrypted ZIP and ZIP64 still need additional codecs or format support.
- **Flatpak:** "Show in folder" answers only while OpenXplorer runs unless the
  desktop's Background portal starts it at login (native/packaging/README.md,
  "Differences inside the Flatpak"). Flathub publication needs the owner.
- **Open and Save dialogs (INT-032):** on Wayland the picker window is a
  modal child of the calling application's window (the portal's
  `parent_window`, `wayland:`), but an X11 caller's window (`x11:`) is not
  attached, so there the dialog stays a window of its own and can open
  behind the caller; the Flatpak cannot offer the feature. GTK's own
  startup still creates its inhibit-portal proxy synchronously on desktops
  without a GNOME or Xfce session manager; the backend answers from its
  dispatch thread so this no longer stalls the portal, but a D-Bus-activated
  instance's first window waits until the portal is up.

## Hardware acceptance still owed

The automated checks run on a private display and session bus with local
fixtures. These need the owner, on real hardware under Zorin OS 18 (Wayland,
then X11), with disposable data:

- **SMB** beyond the owner's own server: other NAS vendors and Samba
  versions, Windows shares, guest and domain sign-in, saved and session
  passwords, rejected credentials, disconnect and reconnect during a copy.
- **Phones** (MTP and PTP, Android and iPhone): browsing, copy to and from the
  phone, replace, rename, delete, unplug during a transfer.
- **USB drives and SD cards**: mount, eject, safely remove, copy across
  filesystems (FAT, exFAT, NTFS), disk full, and "Move by copying?" between
  them.
- **Display and accessibility**: fractional scaling (125, 150 and 175%) on
  Wayland, and the file list, tabs and sidebar with Orca.
- The upgrade from 1.1.4 through **Check for updates** on a real Zorin
  installation, and the rollback to 1.1.4.
- The Flatpak bundle on a distribution without GTK 4.14 (Debian 12), and the
  RPM and Arch packages on their distributions.
- The remaining items of docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md, "Native desktop gate".

## Remaining parity items (66)

Generated from `native/parity/features.toml`; the replacement gate is
every behaviour the Python app had. The other items come from the Dolphin
baseline and GNOME integration. Priority is from the inventory.

## Bridge operations without a native workflow test

`native/parity/bridge.json` still lists 30 operations of the Python app's
bridge whose native replacement has no end-to-end test: bookmark, braveRestore,
braveSync, cacheClear, cacheRefresh, cacheRemove, cacheSet, cacheStatus,
cacheStop, chrome, connect, environment, focusWindow, list, locationApply,
locationCheck, mountPlan, mountVolume, normalise, open, openTerminal, pin,
preferences, quit, search, uiReady, unmount, window, windowMetadata, windows.
