//! The thumbnailers the desktop installs, `thumbnailers/*.thumbnailer` in

//! Files reads): one program each, with the MIME types it makes pictures
//! of. They are the only way to a preview of types neither the
//! thumbnailer service nor gdk-pixbuf knows, such as Unity asset bundles,
//! spreadsheets, and videos on a session without tumbler.
//!
//! [`super::make_thumbnail`] asks them after the service: a forked program
//! costs more than gdk-pixbuf decoding a picture in the app, so a picture
//! the app reads is decoded there, and only one it cannot read (a type
//! without a gdk-pixbuf loader) or one of another kind comes here. The
//! user's `org.gnome.desktop.thumbnailers` settings are honoured, as Files
//! honours them: `disable` names MIME types no program is started for, and
//! `disable-all` turns every one of them off. An entry whose `TryExec`
//! program this computer lacks is skipped too, failing on every item
//! otherwise.
//!
//! A thumbnailer writes a plain PNG, without the keys that keep a
//! thumbnail valid; the app writes the picture into the shared cache
//! itself, as Files does, through [`super::writer`].
