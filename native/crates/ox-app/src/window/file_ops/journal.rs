//! Undo (Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y) (OPS-029, OPS-031).
//!
//! New in the native app; the Python app had neither. The journal belongs
//! to the application ([`crate::app_context::AppContext`]), as Dolphin's
//! undo manager does, so Undo in any window reverses the newest operation
//! of any window. A step is taken from the journal before its reversal
//! runs, so two windows can never take the same one; a reversal refused
//! before it changed anything goes back. Each reversal runs as the
//! window's one operation, with the transfer panel and Cancel, and reuses
//! the safety rules of the operation that reverses it (see
//! [`ox_core::ops::undo`]). The commands are labelled with the operation
//! they reverse ("Undo Rename"). Before Undo moves copies to the Trash
//! that were changed after the copy, it asks, as Dolphin does (OPS-030).
