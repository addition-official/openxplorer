//! Create links, as a drop with Ctrl+Shift or the drop menu's "Create
//! links here" asks (DND-019), and New ▸ Link to file or folder (OPS-004).
//!
//! New in the native app, from the Dolphin baseline. A drop's links are
//! made by ox-core's [`create_links`] as the window's one operation; New ▸
//! Link asks for what the link points to and its name, and a refusal, such
//! as a path where nothing is, stays in the dialog. The new links are
//! selected afterwards, as other operations' items are, and Undo moves
//! them to the Trash (OPS-029).
