//! Cut, Copy and the desktop's clipboard (CLIP-001 to CLIP-011, CLIP-015,
//! CLIP-016).
//!
//! Ports `copySelection`, `refreshClipboard` and `clipboardConsume` of
//! `v2.0.0:desktop/ui/app.js` with the GTK half of `v2.0.0:desktop/file_clipboard.py`.
//! ox-core encodes and decodes the formats ([`ox_core::clipboard`]); this
//! module claims and reads the display's clipboard:
//!
//! - Copy and Cut publish the five formats at once as one clipboard owner,
//!   so Nautilus, Dolphin, terminals and other windows of this app can paste
//!   them.
//! - Reading tries the app's own format, then GNOME's, then the URI
//!   list with the KDE cut marker, each asynchronously, so a slow owner
//!   never freezes the window. When none of them holds a file list, the
//!   clipboard's picture is read, and then its text, which a paste writes
//!   as one new file (CLIP-015). The file list always comes first: a
//!   window of this app offers the copied paths as text beside the file
//!   formats (CLIP-004), and text must never win, or Ctrl+C then Ctrl+V
//!   would write a .txt instead of copying the files.
//! - An empty or failed conversion, an oversized payload or an owner
//!   change during the read all mean "no data" (fail closed, CLIP-005,
//!   CLIP-016).
//! - The window reads the clipboard again whenever it changes and when the
//!   window becomes active (CLIP-009), which enables Paste and dims the
//!   items a cut put on the clipboard (CLIP-002).
//! - After a move-paste the moved items leave the clipboard, but only
//!   while it still holds the same cut (CLIP-008).
//! - The content is local and every format is storable, so GTK hands it
//!   to a clipboard manager when the application quits (`gtk_main_sync`
//!   stores the display's clipboard at shutdown), as
//!   `gtk_clipboard_set_can_store` did in Python (CLIP-010).
