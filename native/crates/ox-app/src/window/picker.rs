//! A window that chooses files for another application: its Open or Save
//! dialog, shown as the explorer itself.
//!
//! New in the native app (INT-032). The desktop portal sends an
//! application's file dialog to the app (see
//! [`ox_core::integration::FileChooserBus`]); the app opens a window in
//! picker mode for it. Everything the user browses with is the normal
//! window: the navigation pane, address bar, search, views and file
//! commands. Picker mode adds the bar at the bottom, as Windows' common
//! file dialog has: the file name (for Open and Save), the type list, the
//! caller's extra choices, and the accept and Cancel buttons. It narrows the
//! listing to the chosen type, or to folders when a folder is chosen, and
//! keeps the window to one tab with no Settings.
//!
//! The rules:
//!
//! - **One answer.** The call is answered exactly once: by the accept
//!   button (or activating a file), by Cancel, Escape or closing the
//!   window, or with "other" when the portal closes the dialog.
//! - **Local files only.** The portal accepts `file://` locations, so a
//!   choice is accepted only where GIO has a path for it: local folders,
//!   and shares and devices that `GVfs` mounts.
//! - **Never overwrite silently.** Saving over an existing file asks
//!   first, as every desktop's dialog does.
//! - **As Windows' dialog.** The File name box takes a name, a path from
//!   the folder shown, `~/…` or a full path: a folder opens, a file is
//!   the choice. Save adds the chosen type's extension to a name that
//!   has neither it nor a known type's, and choosing another type swaps
//!   the old type's extension for the new one's. A file typed in the
//!   address bar is the choice too, a dialog for one file keeps one
//!   selected, Escape and Ctrl+Q cancel, and nothing opens another
//!   window, tab or pane from the dialog.
