//! What a drop does in a folder: copy, move, link, or ask with the drop
//! menu (DND-017, DND-018).
//!
//! Beyond the Python app, which always copied. The action comes from what
//! the drag offers once the desktop has applied the user's modifier: on
//! Wayland GNOME Shell picks one action (Shift moves, Ctrl copies, Alt
//! asks), and on X11 GTK narrows the offer the same way (Ctrl+Shift
//! links; the middle button asks). When several actions remain, a drop
//! copies. A plain drag of this app's own items then does what Windows
//! Explorer does: it moves them onto a folder of their drive and copies
//! them to another drive ([`drive`](super::drive)); Ctrl held at the drop
//! copies and Shift moves. Ask opens the menu of Windows Explorer's
//! right-button drag: Copy here, Move here, Create links here and Cancel.
//!
//! Safety rule "a plain drop never removes its source" (DND-009): a drag
//! from another app that did not offer a copy when it reached the window
//! is refused, as `NativeFileDrop` refused a source offering only Move.
//! Once the desktop applies a modifier, the offer narrows to the chosen
//! action, so the first offer is what tells the two apart. A plain drag
//! from another app is never turned into a move (Shift held over it still
//! moves, as the user asked); a move of this app's own items
//! is run by its own transfer engine, and the drag is still finished as a
//! copy, so its source never deletes anything.
