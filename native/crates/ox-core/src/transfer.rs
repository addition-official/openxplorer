//! Copy, move, Trash and permanent delete.
//!
//! Ports `v2.0.0:desktop/operations.py` and preserves its transfer safety rules.
//! Each rule is named by the id of the feature in
//! `native/parity/features.toml` that specifies it. The code that enforces a
//! rule names that id in a comment, and the tests that prove it carry a
//! parity marker with the same id. The main rules:
//!
//! - XFER-001: a copy is staged privately and published only when complete,
//!   so a partial copy is never visible under its final name.
//! - XFER-002: the engine only deletes staging it created itself, and
//!   XFER-003: it reports any it cannot remove, with its location.
//! - XFER-007: publishing never overwrites a name that appeared meanwhile.
//! - XFER-009 and XFER-010: Replace never loses the existing item before
//!   the new one is installed.
//! - XFER-011: a move is a native rename wherever the backend can do one.
//!   XFER-013: elsewhere (another filesystem, share or device) the move is
//!   refused and the source kept, unless the user agreed to finish such
//!   moves by copying: then the item is copied through staging and only
//!   the source items that are unchanged since their copy are removed,
//!   after the copy was published.
//! - XFER-014: Trash never falls back to permanent deletion.
//! - XFER-020: a protected location anywhere in an affected tree stops the
//!   item before anything changes.
//!
//! | Module | Responsibility |
//! |---|---|
//! | `engine` | The public API and the per-item loop (`run`, `_run_items`) |
//! | `request` | Validating a run's request: its operation, items and destination folder |
//! | `batch` | What a run does with each item, and the settings its items share |
//! | `conflicts` | Skip, Keep both and Replace: the destination name |
//! | `staged_copy` | Staging, publishing and device checks for one copy |
//! | `copy` | The recursive copy into staging (`_copy`) |
//! | `commit` | Publishing, Replace and reversible replacement |
//! | `staging` | Removing the engine's own staging (`_discard_stage`) |
//! | `containment` | Refusing to place a folder inside itself |
//! | `guard` | The write-guard preflight and the nesting limit |
//! | `modes` | Unix modes of local staging folders |
//! | `names` | Staging, backup and validated child names |
//! | `labels` | Progress text |
//! | `limits` | What the destination file system holds: free space, file size, names and links (XFER-028) |
//! | `unstorable` | Asking about names and links the destination cannot store (XFER-028) |
//! | `move_by_copying` | The user's consent to finish moves by copying (XFER-011, XFER-013) |
//! | `source_removal` | Removing the copied source of a move across filesystems (XFER-013) |
//! | `relisting` | Relisting the folders moves took items from (MTP) |
//! | `node` | The [`Node`] storage abstraction the engine works on |
//! | `cancellation` | [`Cancellation`], the user's stop request |
//! | `types` | Operations, modes, conflict policies, progress and the run's result |
//! | `error` | [`TransferError`] and how backend errors map onto it |
//!
//! Every test of `v2.0.0:desktop/tests/test_operations.py` and
//! `v2.0.0:desktop/tests/test_device_staging.py`, and the engine cases of
//! `v2.0.0:desktop/tests/gio_integration.py`, is ported to `tests/transfer.rs`,
//! `tests/transfer_cases/` and `tests/gio_node.rs`, against temporary local
//! files, device test doubles and the production GIO adapter; each port
//! names the Python test it comes from. Still to come with the features
//! they test: the rename cases of `gio_integration.py` and the bridge
//! dispatch of `v2.0.0:desktop/tests/test_rc2.py` (its engine half is ported). The
//! ZIP extractor in [`crate::archive`] secures and removes its staging
//! folder with this module's `secure_local_staging` and
//! [`Node::delete_staging`]; `v2.0.0:desktop/tests/test_zip_extract.py` is ported
//! to its `tests/archive_*.rs`. Native backend limitations are documented
//! in [`crate::gio_node`].
