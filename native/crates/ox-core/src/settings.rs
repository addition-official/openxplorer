//! Shared settings in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/winspace/settings.json`.
//!
//! Ports `Settings` in `v2.0.0:desktop/core.py`, on the private storage of
//! `crate::private_storage` (`v2.0.0:desktop/private_storage.py`). The Python
//! application and this one use the same file, so the protocol matches
//! exactly:
//!
//! * Reading validates against a whitelist and never fails: unreadable
//!   input yields safe defaults plus a [`warning`](Settings::warning).
//! * Every change takes an exclusive `flock` on `settings.lock`, re-reads
//!   the file, applies the change and atomically replaces the file with a
//!   private (0600) copy in a private (0700) directory. Symlinked or
//!   hard-linked settings files are refused, never followed.
//! * Everything the Python app keeps (including `contextMenu`,
//!   `networkInterval`, `autoIndex` and `columnWidths`) is read and written
//!   back, so a change made here never erases a Python setting.
//!
//! One rule goes beyond the Python app: a change never erases a settings
//! file that could not be read completely. It is first renamed to
//! `settings.json.unreadable-…` beside the new file, and the
//! [`warning`](Settings::warning) says where it went. A file private storage
//! refuses is never renamed: the change fails instead.
//!
//! The submodules split the work: `read` reads the file, `mutate` holds
//! the changes, and `save` locks and writes. Reading and saving rely on
//! the private-storage rules of `crate::private_storage`.
//!
//! The `winspace` directory name is a compatibility contract; do not rename
//! it.
