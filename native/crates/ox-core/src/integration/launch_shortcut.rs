//! Super+E opens `OpenXplorer` on KDE Plasma (opt-in), as Win+E opens File
//! Explorer in Windows.
//!
//! On Plasma, Super+E (Meta+E in KDE's words) is a global shortcut that
//! launches Dolphin. Global shortcuts belong to KDE's shortcut service,
//! `kglobalacceld`, reached on the session bus as `org.kde.kglobalaccel`;
//! System Settings > Shortcuts changes them the same way. A desktop file is
//! a component named after it: its `_launch` action runs its command, and
//! each `[Desktop Action]` is an action of that name, which the service runs
//! when the keys are pressed.
//!
//! As Win+E always opens a new File Explorer window, Super+E runs the
//! desktop file's `NewWindow` action (`openxplorer --new-window`), which
//! opens a new window whether or not one is open; `_launch` would only show
//! the open window. Turning it on takes Super+E from the action that has it
//! (Dolphin's launch action, as Plasma ships), keeping that action's other
//! keys, and adds it to that `NewWindow` action's keys. What it took is
//! recorded in the settings folder, so turning it off gives Super+E back to
//! that action. The stable and the preview package each keep a record
//! there; when one took Super+E from the other, the records are joined up
//! so Super+E still goes back to the action it was first taken from. The
//! service saves the change itself, so it lasts across logins. Nothing
//! changes until the user asks (INT-033), other desktops are left alone,
//! and the Flatpak, which cannot reach the service, does not offer it.
