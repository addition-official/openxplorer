//! File operations as the interface starts them: New, Rename, paste
//! conflicts, Delete, copy, move, Duplicate, the Recycle Bin, Undo, and
//! moving tabs between windows.
//!
//! Ports the file-operation branches of `dispatch` in
//! `v2.0.0:desktop/winspace.py` (`create`, `rename`, `templates`,
//! `createTemplate`, `transferConflicts`, `operate`, `trashSupport`), the
//! template half of `v2.0.0:desktop/file_services.py`, `create_item`,
//! `rename_item` and `trash_support` in `v2.0.0:desktop/gio_backend.py`,
//! `v2.0.0:desktop/tab_transfers.py`, and the delete confirmation, progress and
//! completion text of `v2.0.0:desktop/ui/app.js`. Copies, moves, Trash and
//! permanent deletion run on the transfer engine of [`crate::transfer`]
//! with all of its safety rules.
//!
//! Beyond the Python app, from the Dolphin baseline: Duplicate, the
//! Recycle Bin (list, restore, delete, empty), the created items of every
//! operation for selecting them, a new folder under the next free name,
//! Shift+Delete, an answer per item to name conflicts, and an undo journal
//! with Redo (see [`UndoRecord`] for what can be undone).
//!
//! Every operation that touches the filesystem is an `async fn`: its
//! blocking GIO calls run on GIO's worker threads while the caller's main
//! loop keeps running, and it stops when the [`OperationContext`]'s
//! cancellation is cancelled. Progress callbacks run on the worker thread.
//! Nothing here depends on GTK. The interface keeps the rule of one file
//! operation at a time (OPS-024) and cancels the running one through the
//! clone of its cancellation it holds, so the Python bridge's job tokens
//! (the `cancel` request) have no counterpart here.
//!
//! Wording: the place `trash:///` is the Recycle Bin in every message, as
//! [`crate::location`] names it. The Delete command, its confirmations
//! and Undo use Windows Explorer's words ("Delete", "Delete File", "Are you
//! sure you want to move this file to the Recycle Bin?", "Undo Delete";
//! OPS-015, CMD-003).
//!
//! | Module | Responsibility |
//! |---|---|
//! | `context` | The cancellation and write protection of an operation, its worker, and GIO queries that honour the cancellation |
//! | `error` | [`OpsError`] and the bridge's error codes |
//! | `create` | New folder and New file, and New folder under the next free name |
//! | `templates` | The built-in and user templates New offers |
//! | `new_from_template` | New from template, staged privately and published without overwriting, and New ▸ Text document under the next free name |
//! | `pasted_file` | A picture on the clipboard pasted as a new file, with the free-space check (CLIP-015) |
//! | `rename` | Rename, and renaming back for Undo |
//! | `batch_rename` | The "Rename items" dialog's `#` template for several items |
//! | `numbered_rename` | F2 on several items: one name with (1), (2) as in Windows Explorer |
//! | `conflicts` | The name-conflict check before a paste or drop |
//! | `delete_plan` | Trash support, and the Delete and Shift+Delete confirmations |
//! | `run_transfer` | Copy, move, Trash and permanent delete through the engine |
//! | `changed_copies` | Copies changed since their copy, before Undo trashes them |
//! | `resolved_transfer` | A copy or move with an answer per name conflict, inside merged folders too |
//! | `duplicate` | Duplicate in place |
//! | `links` | Symbolic links to dropped items, and New ▸ Link |
//! | `shortcuts` | Shortcuts named as Windows names them, for Send to ▸ Desktop and dropped links |
//! | `folder_groups` | Items grouped by folder, for per-folder runs of the engine |
//! | `results` | Adding up per-item results into one result |
//! | `progress` | Progress labels and throttling |
//! | `report` | The toast or result dialog at the end |
//! | `recycle_bin` | Listing, restoring, deleting and emptying `trash:///` |
//! | `recycle_bin_drag` | Recycle Bin items dragged into a folder |
//! | `undo` | What reverses each operation, and what reverses a reversal |
//! | `journal` | The Undo and Redo stacks |
//! | `undo_apply` | Carrying out an Undo or a Redo |
//! | `unfinished` | Marks of running copies, and what a crashed run left |
//! | `tab_transfer` | Moving a tab to another window |
//!
//! The tests of this service in `v2.0.0:desktop/tests` are ported to
//! `tests/ops_*.rs`, each naming the test it comes from;
//! `ops_tab_transfer.rs` names the two that the typed interface makes
//! unnecessary. Not ported here:
//! `properties`, `list_applications`, `prepare_launch` and
//! `SnapshotProvider` of `v2.0.0:desktop/file_services.py`, which belong to the
//! Properties and Open with services.
