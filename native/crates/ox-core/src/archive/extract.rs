//! Extracting a ZIP into a new folder, all or nothing. Ports
//! `ZipExtractor` of `v2.0.0:desktop/zip_extraction.py` and the checks the
//! `archiveExtract` branch of `dispatch` in `v2.0.0:desktop/winspace.py` runs
//! before it.
//!
//! An extraction never touches existing content:
//!
//! - ARC-012: the output is always a new folder in a real destination
//!   folder; an existing name, even a file or a dangling link, stops it.
//! - ARC-014 to ARC-017: every member is checked before anything is
//!   written (see `plan`).
//! - ARC-020: the write guard is asked about the destination folder, the
//!   new folder and every path inside it before anything is written.
//! - ARC-013: the contents are built in a private staging folder and
//!   published by a rename that never replaces anything. Any failure,
//!   damaged data or cancellation removes the staging folder (see
//!   `staging`).
//! - ARC-018: files are created new and owner-only through an
//!   [`ExtractionOutput`]; archive permissions are never applied.
//!
//! | Module | Responsibility |

//! | `plan` | Checking every member and summarising the archive |
