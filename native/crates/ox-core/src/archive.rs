//! ZIP archives: browsing them read-only, opening one member as a private
//! copy, extracting them into a new folder, and compressing items into a
//! new ZIP.
//!
//! Ports `v2.0.0:desktop/archives.py`, `v2.0.0:desktop/zip_extraction.py`, the archive
//! reader of `v2.0.0:desktop/native_opening.py` and the archive branches of
//! `dispatch` in `v2.0.0:desktop/winspace.py`. The archive is never changed, and:
//!
//! - ARC-003: a listing reads the central directory only; nothing is
//!   decompressed or written.
//! - ARC-004: members with unsafe names, links and special files are never
//!   shown or opened, only counted.
//! - ARC-005: a central directory over 32 MiB or more than 100,000 members
//!   is left to an archive manager.
//! - ARC-006: only the one chosen document, image or media member is ever
//!   decompressed for viewing, into a private read-only copy.
//! - ARC-007: archives on shares are read in place through seekable GIO
//!   streams.
//! - ARC-012 to ARC-020: an extraction creates a new folder, checks every
//!   member first, builds it privately and publishes it all or nothing.
//! - ARC-023: compressing writes a new ZIP privately and publishes it
//!   without replacing anything; links are never followed.
//!
//! Every operation blocks on I/O; each has an `…_in_background` variant
//! that runs it on a GIO worker thread for the main loop to await. All of
//! them take a [`Cancellation`](crate::transfer::Cancellation) and stop
//! soon after it is cancelled.
