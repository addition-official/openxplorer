//! `v2.0.0:desktop/operations.py`.
//!
//! Rules enforced here:
//! - XFER-007: publishing ([`Node::publish`]) is a native rename that never
//!   overwrites. If another program took the name meanwhile, publishing
//!   fails and nothing is overwritten. On local disks the kernel checks the
//!   name and renames in one step; filesystems without that fall back to
//!   GIO's check-then-rename, which leaves a window of microseconds, as in
//!   the Python app (see `gio_node::move_item`).
//! - XFER-009: Replace (an explicit user choice) merges same-name folders,
//!   keeping destination-only items, and overwrites files only through the
//!   backend's explicit overwrite move. A file/folder type mismatch is left
//!   untouched rather than deleting a tree as a side effect of a batch
//!   choice.
//! - XFER-010: where one-step overwrite is unsupported (MTP), the old file
//!   is renamed aside to an unguessable backup name, the new one installed,
//!   and the old name restored if installing fails. These renames are not
//!   interruptible: a device can finish a rename after the client stopped
//!   waiting, and stopping midway would leave the public name empty.
