//! Copying one top-level item: build it in private staging, then publish it
//! under its final name. Ports the copy branch of `_run_items` in
//! `v2.0.0:desktop/operations.py`.
//!
//! Rules enforced here:
//! - XFER-001: a copy is built under an unguessable
//!   `.winspace-transfer-<32 hex>.part` name and published only when
//!   complete, so a partial copy is never visible under its final name.
//!   Local and network destinations get a private staging folder (created
//!   exclusively with `create_directory`, owner-only when local) holding
//!   `payload`.
//! - XFER-021: device destinations (MTP) build the item itself under a
//!   hidden sibling name and publish it with a same-folder rename (MTP
//!   `SetObjectPropValue`). Uploads therefore never need MTP `MoveObject`,
//!   which devices such as Android 7 and 8 do not offer. A device's success
//!   report is never trusted: the final name must exist and the staged name
//!   must be gone.
//! - XFER-023: a copy within one device (MTP `CopyObject`) keeps the
//!   source's name whatever target is requested, so it is built under that
//!   name inside a private folder, renamed there, and moved out under the
//!   same name. As in the Python app, that last move needs MTP
//!   `MoveObject`; a device without it gets an error that says so.
//! - XFER-002: only staging this item created is recorded for cleanup: a
//!   failed exclusive `create_directory`, or an upload refused because its
//!   name exists, grants no right to delete anything.
//! - XFER-001: the staging stays private in messages too. An error names
//!   the final item, never the staging it was built in.
