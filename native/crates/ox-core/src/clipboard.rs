//! File clipboard formats shared with GNOME, KDE and the Python application.
//!
//! Ports the pure functions of `v2.0.0:desktop/file_clipboard.py`
//! (`validate_clipboard`, `encode_clipboard`, `decode_clipboard`). This
//! module does not claim or clear the system clipboard. A GTK caller must
//! also reject reads whose owner changed while the payload was being
//! fetched.
//!
//! A selection is published in five formats at once:
//!
//! | MIME type | Read by | Payload |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`CUSTOM`] | Python and native app windows | JSON with mode, URIs and token |
//! | [`GNOME`] | Nautilus and other GTK apps | `copy` or `cut`, then one URI per line |
//! | [`URI_LIST`] | every file manager | CRLF-terminated URIs |
//! | [`TEXT`] | terminals and editors that take text | each item's path, one per line, when every path is one line |
//! | [`KDE_CUT`] | Dolphin and other KDE apps | `1` for cut, `0` for copy |
//!
//! Paste tries [`CUSTOM`], then [`GNOME`], then [`URI_LIST`] with the
//! [`KDE_CUT`] marker of the same clipboard owner. [`FileListFormat`] names
//! these three formats, and [`decode()`] reads one of them. [`TEXT`] is
//! published for other applications only.
//!
//! Text and images are never a file list: text copied in another
//! application may not claim to name files. They are pasted as one new
//! file instead ([`PastedContent`], CLIP-015), and the file list is always
//! read first, so a copy that offers both stays a copy.
