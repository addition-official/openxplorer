//! Duplicate: a copy of each selected item next to itself.
//!
//! New in the native app, from the Dolphin baseline ("Duplicate Here"). It
//! is a copy into the item's own folder with the Keep both policy, so it
//! has every safety rule of a copy (private staging, publishing that never
//! overwrites, the write protection) and the app's own duplicate names:
//! `report - Copy.pdf`, then `report - Copy (2).pdf`, as Keep both names
//! them (XFER-008). Items from several folders, as a search can select, are
//! copied into their own folders one folder at a time.
//!
//! Dolphin names a duplicate `report copy.pdf`; OPS-034 in
//! `native/parity/features.toml` records that Duplicate keeps the app's
//! own Windows Explorer names (`- Copy`) instead, so a duplicate and a
//! Keep both copy are named alike.
